mktoc v1.0 // (c) 2008, Patrick C. McGinty, mktoc[@]tuxcoder[dot]com

Description:
   Convert an ExactAudioCopy (EAC) CUE file to the TOC format that is readable
   by 'cdrdao'.

   This program focuses primarily on EAC CUE files. It includes support for
   non-compliant CUE files, including pregaps at the end of previous tracks.
   There are additional features to detect and fix incorrect file path names and
   extension types.

Usage:
   mktoc.py [CUE_FILE]
   mktoc.py [CUE_FILE] -o [TOC_FILE]
   mktoc.py < CUE_FILE

   CUE_FILE must contain a valid CUE format. When FILE is not provided, the
   program will read from STDIN. All output will be sent to STDOUT.

   All attempts will be made to preserve any and all information from the input
   file. For any case where the CUE file contains unknown or bad values, the
   user will be notified on STDERR.
